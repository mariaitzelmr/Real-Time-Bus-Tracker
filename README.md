Bus Tracking Exercies

#Description

In this map you will follow route of 9 buses of Massachussets! I'd love to have this going for Mexico's city bus routes, but a little bit of paperwork is required for that prior getting the permissions for the data, so we'll be showing Massachussets info for now! Each bus is marked with a different color and they update their positions each 15 seconds, so please be patient if you don't see them moving right away.

#How to run

Download the full project, if you keep the files in the same folder, just drop the index.html in your browser to start the game.
If you change the location of the files or if you want to change their names, remember to set the right path and file name in the <script></script> and < link > tags in index.html for the .js file and .css file respectively.

#Future improvements!

-Change Massachussets info form Mexico's public transport system.

-Add bus, metrobus and metro tracking system.

-Each line will have it's own color!
